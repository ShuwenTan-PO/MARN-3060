    "For the final group assignment, students will work in pairs or small groups (2–3 members) to investigate a scientific topic related to the course. The project should involve **quantitative analysis** of oceanographic datasets (e.g., observations collected during the field trip).

    "## Presentation Structure\n",
    "Each group presentation should include the following components:\n",
    "- **Introduction**: \n",
    "Briefly introduce the scientific question or topic your group chose to investigate. Explain what motivated your choice—was it a recent event, a gap in understanding, or a curiosity sparked during the field trip or lectures? Clearly state the objective of your study.\n",
    "- **Background / Scientific Context**: \n",
    "Provide an overview of the relevant oceanographic processes (e.g., tides, waves, inner shelf dynamics, estuarine circulation). Describe the physical mechanisms involved and how they relate to your topic. Include any known theories or previous findings that help frame your investigation. Highlight why this topic matters in the context of coastal or oceanographic systems.\n",
    "- **Methods**:\n",
    "Describe the data sources used in your project. Be specific about how the data were collected or obtained, and how they support your analysis.\n",
    "  - *Field Trip Data*: If you used data collected during the field trip, explain which instruments were used (e.g., YSI, turbidity meter), the site locations, and the resolution or frequency of the measurements.\n",
    "  - *Public Datasets*: If you used publicly available datasets, list the sources (e.g., NOAA, USGS, Argo), describe what variables they measure, and note whether they are observational data or model outputs.\n",
    "  - *Literature Review*: If your project is based on a review of published studies, list the papers you reviewed and explain how you synthesized metadata or findings from those sources to support your analysis.\n",
    "- **Results**: \n",
    "Present your key findings. Include data visualizations, figures, and analysis. Discuss whether your results align with or challenge concepts covered in class. Highlight any trends, anomalies, or patterns you discovered. Discuss whether your results align with or challenge concepts covered in class, and explain possible reasons for any discrepancies. Use graphs or maps to support your interpretation.\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: \n",
    "Summarize the main takeaways from your project. What did you learn? What are the implications? Connect your findings back to the original research question. Emphasize the significance of your results in the broader context of oceanography or environmental science.\n",
    "- **Discussion**:\n",
    "Reflect on the limitations of your analysis, potential sources of error, and ideas for future research. Consider how your findings fit into the broader oceanographic context. Could your approach be applied to other regions or systems? What additional data or methods would improve your study?"
