    "2) [GO-BGC Argo](https://www.go-bgc.org/array-status#locations), which utilizes autonomous robotic floats to measure temperature, salinity, pH, nitrate, chlorophyll, suspended particles, light, and derived parameters DIC, pCO2 and total alkalinity in the ocean from the surface to 2000 m. These floats can operate continuously for years in all weather conditions, providing near real-time observations of ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystems throughout the world’s oceans.
