    "The Indian Ocean tsunami was generated by a Mw 9.1 earthquake (3.295°N 95.982°E), 2004-12-26 00:58:53 UTC, off the west coast of northern Sumatra. The earthquake caused a massive tsunami, known as the Boxing Day Tsunami after the Boxing Day holiday, or as the Asian Tsunami, which devastated communities along the surrounding coasts of the Indian Ocean, killing an estimated 227,898 people in 14 countries, especially in Aceh (Indonesia), Sri Lanka, Tamil Nadu (India), and Khao Lak (Thailand). The below graphic displays NOAA model forecast results, showing qualitative and quantitative information about the tsunami, including tsunami wave interaction with ocean floor bathymetric features, and neighboring coastlines. The red star marks the earthquake epicenter. White contours show the Tsunami wave crests at hourly intervals following the earthquake predicted by the model. Tsunami model amplitude information is shown color-coded according to the scale bar. See information https://nctr.pmel.noaa.gov/indo_1204.html. \n",

    "<b>Exercise 1:</b> The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami had a wavelength of several hundred kilometers, and the average ocean depth is 3741 m. Is a tsunami considered a shallow or deep water wave? Estimate its propagation speed and the travel time from the earthquake epicenter (3.295°N, 95.982°E) to Sri Lanka (7.132°N, 81.861°E). (1 pt) Explain the curvature of the white contours (representing tsunami wave crests at hourly intervals) in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, focus on the coastal regions and over the Southwest Indian Ocean Ridge. (1 pt) Estimate the wave height near the Sri Lankan coast (~1 m depth) using the offshore wave amplitude (note that wave height = 2 * wave amplitude) and the wave shoaling relationship. (1 pt)\n",

    "level was +1.1 m relative to mean sea level (Komar, McDougal, and Ruggiero, 1996). Calculate the maximum set-up, $\\bar{\\eta}_{max}$, the 1/2$R_S$ run-up elevation above that set-up level, and the total water elevation (tide plus set-up and run-up) achieved during the storm. Compare this total water elevation with the surveyed elevation of 3.5 m for the junction between the beach and the base of the sea cliff, to judge whether cliff erosion would have been severe. Based on projections of wave statistics, it is estimated that the 100-year extreme storm would generate a deep-water significant wave height of 8.6 m and period 18 sec. For the same tide level of +1.1 m MSL, calculate the run-up and total water elevation for this potential event. How susceptible is the sea cliff to erosion during such extreme conditions? (1 pt)\n",
