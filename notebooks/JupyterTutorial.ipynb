    "**---- 1. Install Miniforge ----**\n",
    ">Miniforge is a community-driven, minimal installer for Conda that is pre-configured to use the conda-forge channel by default. Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system for installing multiple versions of software packages and their dependencies and switching easily between them. It works on Linux, OS X and Windows, and was created for Python programs but can package and distribute any software.\n",
    "1) First of all, know your operating system (Windows or MacOS).\n",
    "2) Follow [instruction](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#install) to install Miniforge for your operating system: e.g., for macOS, run `curl -L -O \"https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\"` in your terminal\n",
    "<!-- 2) Download installer (via https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html or run \"curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh\" in your terminal) -->\n",
    "<!-- 3) Excecute the shell script (if you're using a Mac, run \"bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh\" in your terminal) -->\n",

    "\n",
    "1) If you have a macbook, the easiest way is to install Homebrew first and then run in your terminal: first, open a terminal and install the package manager [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by running `/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"` then run `brew install git` to install git; or you can download and install git from their [website](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n",
    "2) clone GitHub repository `git clone https://github.com/ShuwenTan-PO/MARN-3060.git` to access to the latest class materials\n",

    "1) Go to the class directory\n",
    "2) Create the environment from the environment.yml file: run `conda env create -f environment.yml` in terminal \n",
    "3) Activate the new environment: `conda activate MARN-3060`\n",
    "4) Verify that the new environment was installed correctly: `conda env list`\n",
    "5) View a list of the packages in an environment: `conda list` \n",
    "\n",
    "**---- 3*. Or you can make a Conda working environment from scratch ----**\n",
    "1) Create a new environment: `conda create -n MARN-3060 python scipy numpy matplotlib dask pandas xarray xgcm netcdf4 cmocean gsw xhistogram jupyterlab ipykernel wget curl pip cartopy`\n",
    "2) Activate the new environment: `conda active MARN-3060`\n",
    "3) Install gsw to your Conda environment: `conda install -c conda-forge gsw`\n",
    "4) Save environment variables: `conda env export > environment.yml`\n",
