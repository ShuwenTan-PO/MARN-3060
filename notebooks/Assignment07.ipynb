    "This assignment examines data collected during two field trips: our 10/31 visit to the Avery Point dock, and another group's 11/3 trip, which covered the route from <font color=\"red\">Norwich Harbor to the Montville Power Plant and the Coast Guard Academy</font>. The respective datasets are provided in the files titled \"UCONN 3060 data 10_31_2025.pdf\" and \"MSMHS 11-3-25.pdf.\" <font color=\"forestgreen\">Note that the datasheets are color-coded. For example, blue represents the Navigation Data Sheet, which includes readings taken in the navigation room. Orange, green, and pink contains nutrient concentration we measured in the Enviro-Lab.</font>. \n",

    "- During what tidal phase (flood vs. ebb) did the stations from the two trips occur? You will need to list the tidal phase for all three stations during the 11/3 trip and one station during the 10/31 trip (tip: find this information in the Navigation Data Sheet). (0.2 pt)\n",
    "- Discuss the expected direction and relative intensity of seawater intrusion versus river discharge during flood and ebb tides. (0.3 pt)\n",
    "- Discuss how you expect the surface salinity to differ among the three stations sampled on 11/3. Explain why, and whether or not you would expect the same amount of salinity change during flood tide. Refer to the salinity measurements from the three stations sampled on 11/3, and discuss whether the observations confirm your expectations. (0.5 pt)\n",
    "- How does the bottom salinity measured at Norwich Harbor on 11/3 compare to that at Avery Point Dock on 10/31? How do you expect salinity from surface to bottom to vary during ebb tide versus flood tide? Refer to the salinity measurements from the three stations sampled on 11/3, and discuss whether the observations confirm your expectations. (Tip: see how tidal phases influence the movement and mixing of water in the estuary in the figure in Lecture 06, section 3.1) (0.5 pt)\n",

    "- Calculate the mean nutrient concentrations (ammonium, phosphate, nitrate) from the surface water samples collected at five stations (A–F; see GPS coordinates in the Examples & Exercises) along the Thames River on 10/31. Compare the magnitudes among the five stations, identify which station had the highest surface nutrient levels for each nutrient, and determine whether all three nutrients had their highest concentrations at the same station. Explore possible reasons for these patterns. (1 pt)\n",

    "Hypoxia is defined as low levels of dissolved oxygen (typically less than 2–3 milligrams of oxygen per liter of water). Review the dissolved oxygen data measured by the TSI meter at the three stations (Norwich Harbor, Montville Power Plant, Coast Guard Academy) sampled on 11/3, and identify the relationship between dissolved oxygen and depth. Identify any regions where hypoxia is present. Does hypoxia occur at different stations at the same depth? Explain possible reasons for this observation. (1 pt) \n",

    "- Tip 1: Surface winds are stronger near the mouth while the upper estuary is characterized by lighter winds at river level due to sheltering from the hills that surround the area and distance from open water. Consequently, winddriven mixing is most likely less energetic in the upper estuary. - <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.lib.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1262&context=gs_theses\">Hacker Gibson, Melissa, \"Physical Processes that Affect Hypoxia in the Thames River Estuary, USA\" (2012).

    "For example, temperature measurements at the Norwich Harbor station suggest an increase in temperature with depth, which was unexpected to me. I initially wondered whether colder water above warmer water might cause instability (thinking about boiling water on stove). However, this pattern makes sense considering that the air temperature was colder than the river water, leading to surface cooling. Additionally, salinity increases with depth that cuases density also increases with depth, which prevent the water from being unstable.\n",
