    "### 1). Cross-shelf circulation for unstratified water\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of **downwelling-favorable along-shelf wind stress** over an along-shelf uniform **unstratified** water column. The unstratified along-shelf response is **symmetric** with respect to wind stress direction, so reversing the wind stress to upwelling-favorable just reverses the circulation pattern. \n",
    "1. In very shallow water (roughly h < 0.5δs ), the stress is approximately constant throughout the water column so there is essentially no cross-shelf circulation and the flow is downwind, consistent with a nonrotating fluid.\n",
    "2. The onshore **Ekman transport** near the surface results in a convergence in shallow waters (0.5δs < h < 2δs, where δs ∝ δ$_{Ekman}$ is the boundary-layer thickness) that initially causes sea level to rise toward the coast.\n",
    "3. This sea level change leads to the **geostrophic setup** that results in a cross-shelf pressure gradient that drives a **geostrophic along-shelf flow**.\n",
    "4. This geostrophic along-shelf flow is most evident outside of the innershelf where the surface (h > 2δs) and bottom boundary layers do not overlap so there is an **interior** region without turbulent stresses, the resulting cross-shelf pressure gradient **balances** a geostrophic along-shelf flow.\n",
    "5. The **bottom stress** due to the geostrophic along-shelf flow drives the\n",
    "**offshore flow** (Ekman transport) in the **bottom boundary layer** that compensates for the onshore surface flow.\n",
    "6. In shallow water where the surface and bottom boundary layers do overlap, the\n",
    "surface stress is transmitted directly to the bottom by turbulent momentum fluxes.\n",

    "completely shut down. Offshore of the front, there is offshore flow in the surface boundary layer\n",
    "and onshore flow in the bottom boundary layer (Figure 5a).\n",
    "- **Stratification is maintained** onshore of the front because the density of the water transported onshore in the bottom boundary layer increases as it is drawn from deeper depths along the sloping bottom.\n",
    "- The resulting stratification over the inner shelf, although weaker than the stratification offshore, allows the cross-shelf circulation to extend over the inner shelf. As a result, upwelling is spread over a broader portion of the inner shelf than downwelling.\n",
